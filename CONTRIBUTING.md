How to contribute
---------------------------------------

Alright, I'm gonna go straight to the point here

We're gonna use single master branch, so if you want to edit assets or blueprints, say so at LINE/Discord group before doing so

If you want add some asset and/or feature, make sure it is on it's own and not dependant on any other assets that's being worked on. 
If you have to refer to said asset, contact others or me to make sure there's no conflict.
Otherwise, put the asset on their respective folder in Nocturne. Remember, always pull first before pushing.

Any kind of question can be asked on group chat or directly to me
